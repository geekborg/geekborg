- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @geekborg. I was born in 1973, and wrote my first lines of code around the age of 10. Never stopped since.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
	- mathematics: numbers theory, functions, calculus, trigonometry, Cayley-Dickson's constructions, ...
	- C and C++, for their versatility and power.
	- data structures, low level algorithms, hashing functions, cryptography, ...
